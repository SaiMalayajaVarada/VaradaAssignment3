21.	What is Serialization? How do we achieve it? 
A. Serialization in Java is an important concept that deals with the conversion of objects into a byte stream to transport the java objects from one Java Virtual Machine to the other and recreate them to the original form

A Java object is serializable if and only if its class or any of its parent classes implement either the java.io.Serializable interface or its subinterface, java.io.Externalizable.

In the Serialization process, we convert an object’s state into a byte stream so that it could be transferred from one JVM to the other and revert the byte stream back into the original object.

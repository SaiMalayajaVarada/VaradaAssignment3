2.	Can we change the scope of the overridden method in the subclass for private, public, default and protected? Explain how can it be changed for each scope?

A. Yes, an overridden method can have a different access modifier but it cannot lower the access scope.

The following rules for inherited methods are enforced -

Methods declared public in a superclass also must be public in all subclasses.
Methods declared protected in a superclass must either be protected or public in subclasses; they cannot be private.
Methods declared private are not inherited at all, so there is no rule for them.

24.	Can we call the garbage collector explicitly? Will it trigger the garbage collector?
A. We can call the Garbage Collection explicitly in two ways

System.gc() method
Runtime.gc() method
The java.lang.Runtime.freeMemory() method returns the amount of free memory in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Calling the gc() method may result in increasing the value returned by the freeMemory.
